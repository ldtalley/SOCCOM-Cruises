# Pre-cruise document creation for SOCCOM (Observations)
## by Sawyer Brand

Hello! This is the repository where the code to create SOCCOM's pre-cruise documentation resides. All code will be written in Jupyter Notebooks to 
ensure easy access for people who have very little experience with Python, and the code itself contains many comments and paragraphs to explain anything 
in case the user struggles with any type of code. 

The most important jupyter notebook is called 'Pre-Cruise-Creation.ipynb'. This is the notebook you will want to run in order to create the html document used to plan cruises. 
The other notebooks are for each individual plot, and were used to debug any individual issues before creating the overall notebook.
